Working with YAML in the current Dreamweaver version is relatively unproblematic.  The only necessary adjustment is turning off print stylesheets in design mode.  Dreamweaver interprets the CSS rule @media print incorrectly and mixes the screen and print layouts together.  You must activate "Design Notes" in your project settings in order to work with alternate stylesheets.

Turning off the print stylesheets is then easy enough in the "CSS styles" window in the "Properties" field.  Call up the context menu there with a right mouse click and choose "Design Time...".  In the dialog box select the print stylesheet in the section "Hide at Design Time".

Now close any HTML document and open it again.  The changed settings should now be in effect and your YAML-based layout is error-free in Design Mode, allowing you to edit it there without any problems.  

Enjoy YAML!
